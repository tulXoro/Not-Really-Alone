# Not Really Alone

## Description
Allows users to text and chat anonymously. Made for UCR Rose Hackathon 2021. It can be viewed [here](https://devpost.com/software/we-re-not-alone).

## How it works

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store chat.

## Usage

Use this however you see fit.

## Installation
*Note: You will need to create a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project and configure it. It used an old version of Firebase so it may not work as intended.*

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. Install necessary dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Start the app using `npm run dev`.
